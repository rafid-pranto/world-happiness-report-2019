The “World Happiness Report” is published annually by the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network, which contains articles and rankings of national happiness worldwide based on the respondents’ ratings of their own lives. This project aims to investigate if there is a statistically significant relationship between the happiness score of a country and its other demographic variables. In this project, the relationship between the happiness scores and four demographic variables: (i) life expectancy at birth (in years), (ii) expected years of schooling, (iii) mean years of schooling, and (iv) Gross National Income (GNI) per capita (in USD) of a total of 131 countries in 2019 has been analyzed.

The 2019 happiness scores of the countries are collected from the World Happiness Report website and then converted into a .csv file. The data of all four predictor variables for the same year are collected from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) website and then converted into a separate .csv file. Two datasets are created for these files in R and then they are merged together in a new dataset using the inner_join( ) function, so that only countries in both datasets are retained. Also, the drop_na( ) function has been used to retain only the countries for which all the values are present.
